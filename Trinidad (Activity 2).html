<H1> Ring Around the World</H1>
<H2>by Annette Wynne</H2>
<HR>
<P> Ring around the world<BR>
Taking hands together<BR>
All across the temperature lands<BR>
And the torrid weather <BR>
<BR><BR>
Past the royal palm trees<BR>
By the ocean sand<BR>
Make a ring around the world<BR>
Taking each other's hand; <BR>
<BR><BR>
In the valleys, on the hill<BR>
Over the prove spaces,<BR>
There's a ring around the world<BR>
Made of children's the world<BR>
